## Northwind OData Feed
### The dataset used in this chapter is hosted via an OData protocol (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/odata/overview). It concerns a fictitious specialty food importer called *Northwind Traders*.
### It is loaded directly into PowerBI through the OData Connector, thus the data does not need to be present on the machine beforehand.
### The various *exercise_x_y.pbix* files will contain the navigation steps necessary to access the relevant tables used for each exercise.
### For posterity, I am placing the link to the dataset below:
